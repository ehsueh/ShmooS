<h4>Reading summaries</h4>

I. Triggering of Pheromone Signaling Pathway
#:pheromone binds to Ste2 (GPCR)
#:triggers G_alpha to release G_beta and G_gamma
#:G_beta_gamma has 3 effectors:
#::Ste20 associates with Bem1 and localize to membrane by binding with Cdc42
:::*Bem1: involved in establishing polarity (binds Ste5, Ste20, Cdc42, Cdc24)
#:: Ste5 and Cdc24 which further triggers cascade leading to gene expression involved in matting response.
#:: Far1-Cdc24 complex 
:::*Cdc24: a GEF for Cdc42-GDP--> Cdc42-GTP
:::*Far1: inhibits cell-cycle progression (MAPK substrate)

II. Recycling mechanisms of Cdc42
#: Fast - mediated by a guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (GDI) called Rdi1
#: Slow - endocytosis process mediated by actin patch

<h4>Ideas for Abstraction</h4>
Some crude ideas:
#: Graph: take all proteins/ biofactors involved in the pathway as the node set. There exist an edge if an interaction of a specified type exists. (e.g. there is an edge from Cdc42_i to Ste20_j if Cdc42_i binds to Ste20_j) 
#: Matrix: represent the cell surface with a mxn matrix where m is the 
Each protein type involved will be represented by a m by 3 matrix where m is the number of proteins of that type. I.e. row r of Cdc42 matrix represents the rth Cdc42 which is located in the cell by the coordinate (Cdc42[r][0], Cdc42[r][1], Cdc42[r][2]).
#: Colouring: Represent the cell as an RGB colour space. I.e. RGB corresponding to x,y,z so the cell will be a (255,255,255) colour space.
