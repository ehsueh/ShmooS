Some numbers that might be of interest for our stimulation:
(Copy-and-pasted from Readings)

- 10,000 pheromone receptors on the surface of an unstimulated[1]
yeast cell, coupled to about the same number of G-proteins

- Cdc42 exhibits a considerable membrane diffusion rate of 0.036 μ2/s[2]

- amount of Ste5 and Ste11 in the cell is estimated to be between 500 and 1000 molecules[1]

- As measured by loss of fluorescence-resonance energy transfer (FRET) between Gα and Gβγ, the G protein is maximally active within 30 s after pheromone addition[1]

- diffusion constant (on membrane) of cdc42, cdc24 and bem1:
D_2 = 0.03 um^2/s (prenylated GFP) [3]

- 11um^2/s (diffusion constant for cytosolic GFP) [3]

- 1650  Rho GDI per cell [3]

- 3000 cdc42 a cell [3]

- cytosolic fraction of cdc42 = 50% [3]

- average cell radius for G1-arrested cells used in this study to 3.956 +/- 0.05 um (n=63) [3]

- 6500 bem1 per cell [3]

- 1000 cdc24 per cell [3]
