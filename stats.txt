Some numbers that might be of interest for our stimulation:
(Copy-and-pasted from Readings)

- 10,000 pheromone receptors on the surface of an unstimulated[1]
yeast cell, coupled to about the same number of G-proteins
- Cdc42 exhibits a considerable membrane diffusion rate of 0.036 μ2/s[2]
- amount of Ste5 and Ste11 in the cell is estimated to be between 500 and 1000 molecules[1]
- As measured by loss of fluorescence-resonance energy transfer (FRET) between Gα and Gβγ, the G protein is maximally active within 30 s after pheromone addition[1]
